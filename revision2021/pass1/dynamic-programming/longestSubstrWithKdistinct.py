https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= k <= 50
